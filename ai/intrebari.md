Hello! What brings you here today?
Can you describe the pain? Is it sharp or dull?
Does the tooth feel "taller" or "longer" than the others when you close your mouth?
Does it hurt constantly or only when you bite down?
Does it hurt when you drink cold water?
Does hot coffee bother the tooth?
Have you noticed any swelling on your face or gums?
Do you have a fever?

POATE:
I am going to gently tap on your tooth. Tell me if it hurts.
Does it hurt if I press on the gum above the tooth?
